# Yet Another Defusal Situation (YADS)
YADS is a project made during our third year of IG2I, a French engineering school.

This project is a game very similar to the game [Keep Talking and Nobody explodes](https://keeptalkinggame.com/), where there are two sides trying to defuse a bomb. The bomb in this case is a [Joy-Pi](https://joy-it.net/en/products/rb-joypi).

### The defusers
The defusers are those who have access to the bomb. They will need to listen the experts' instructions on how to defuse the bomb they have in front of them. To do such a thing, they will sometimes need to give informations that are located onto the bomb. This can be its serial number, leds switching on and off, and many else.

### The experts
The experts, however, have completly no access to the bomb (they can't touch it nor see it), they however have the manual at disposition. (The manual can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sQ-K-jtkv5vL2fq0PyQvCJ-PXObuS6Ps/view?usp=drive_link). They have to blindly give instructions to the defusers, sometimes asking for information that they would require.

### The bomb
At the start of a game, the bomb will display a timer, which the players will need to defuse before it goes down to 0. If the players make 3 errors, the bomb will consider that as a failure and will detonate.

Good luck!

## Installation
Unfortunately, due to the project being made strictly for the scenario of demonstrating it for school, we are unable to make a comprehensive guide to install it without it taking more than an hour and multiple different installations (if the posession of a Joy-Pi wasn't enough!)
This Github is strictly for portfolio purposes. If you need help with handling the Joy-PI C API, feel free to look at the code! You can use the magazine as well (present in the references segment)
